Most concepts were understandable, but some sessions needed more explanation.. The main challenge was following the coding part within limited time.. More practice sessions would help improve understanding.",Neutral
2026-01-08 17:32:00,"The overall experience of the AI and Machine Learning workshop was excellent and very engaging.. The concepts were explained clearly with good examples, making them easy to understand.. I found supervised machine learning algorithms and the project sessions most useful.. I found supervised machine learning algorithms and the project sessions most useful.. Initially some algorithms were challenging, but hands-on practice helped overcome the difficulties.",Positive
2026-01-08 17:54:53,"The AI and ML workshop was very engaging and informative. The concepts were explained clearly with good examples and practical demonstrations. Supervised ml algorithms and the project based session were the most useful . Some algorithms were challenging initially, but hands on practice helped me understand them better . Including more real-world projects and extending the workshop duration would be beneficial ",Positive
2026-01-08 17:58:24,"The overall experience of the workshop was confusing and difficult to follow . Many AI and ML concepts were explained too quickly without proper clarity . Some algorithms were covered, but they were hard to understand the algorithms . I struggled a lot with the coding sessions and understanding the algorithms . The pace should be slower and more basic explanation and practice sessions should be added ",Negative
